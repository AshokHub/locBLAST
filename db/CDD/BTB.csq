>gnl|Smart|BTB Broad-Complex, Tramtrack and Bric a brac; Domain in Broad-Complex, Tramtrack and Bric a brac. Also known as POZ (poxvirus and zinc finger) domain. Known to be a protein-protein interaction motif found at the N-termini of several C2H2-type transcription factors as well as Shaw-type potassium channels. Known structure reveals a tightly intertwined dimer formed via interactions between N-terminal strand and helix structures. However in a subset of BTB/POZ domains, these two secondary structures appear to be missing. Be aware SMART predicts BTB/POZ domains without the beta1- and alpha1-secondary structures
