>gnl|Smart|BTK Bruton's tyrosine kinase Cys-rich motif; Zinc-binding motif containing conserved cysteines and a histidine. Always found C-terminal to PH domains (but not all PH domains are followed by BTK motifs). The crystal structure shows this motif packs against the PH domain. The PH+Btk module pair has been called the Tec homology (TH) region
